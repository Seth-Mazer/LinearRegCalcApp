No fancy preview yet.

As of this current bare-bones readme 6/03/2025,
All math works correctly, and prints both the Regression Equation and Coefficient of Determination to the terminal
This is a linear model, using lienar regression. It will work for n features.

As of this current draft, you can indeed select any CSV, and assuming all rows are numerical, calculate your yHat/reg equation and CoD based on the rest of the columns.
However, GUI implementation is wonky right now. You can click upload to upload, and you can run.

**Update 6-03-2025** Entry field now works. 

Current caveats:
- ðŸš« Delightful Looking Gui
- ðŸš« 3D Chart with Regression Plane for only 2 features (indep. variables)
- ðŸš« 2D Chart with typical scatter plot for only 1 feature
- ðŸš« Error handling to only print Reg Eq and CoD when there is more than 3 features
- ðŸš« Error handling to make sure all columns within the CSV are numerical (May not matter.. will look into.. It may depend)
- ðŸš« Built Executable
